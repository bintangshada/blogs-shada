            <p className="mb-4">My name is Bintang Shada Kawibya Putra but you can call me Shada, a little bit about myselfâ€”to be honest, I don&apos;t really know what I want to focus on right now (dd23/MM09/yy25), so I&apos;m trying everything, but I tend to get bored with things easily. That&apos;s why I created this website, which might become a story about my life journey. I made it simple, just the way I want it, so don&apos;t expect too much. And I hope I can write a lot of blogs here too, hehe.</p>
            <p className="mb-4">I am currently studying at UPN &quot;Veteran&quot; Yogyakarta in the Computer Science program. Before that, I also attended a vocational high school at SMKN 1 Bantul, majoring in Software Engineering. What else? I enjoy reading books in my free time and I also like exploring remote areas of the city on my own. If I could choose another career, I might want to become a zookeeper, as I enjoy interacting with animals. That&apos;s all for now (dd24/MM09/yy25).</p>
